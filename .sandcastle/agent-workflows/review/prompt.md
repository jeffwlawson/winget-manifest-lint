# WHAT TO CHECK

Read `CONTEXT.md` and `CLAUDE.md` first, then explore the changed files in context.

1. **Correctness against the issue** — does the change actually do what the linked issue asked?
2. **Rule conventions** — rules are pure (no I/O, no network, no clock), return `Diagnostic[]`,
   never print/throw/exit, use `positionOf()` for positions, and are registered in
   `src/rules/index.ts` ordered by id. Flag any deviation.
3. **Domain correctness** — does it respect the role-vs-ManifestType distinction and the rule
   classes in `CONTEXT.md`? A rule whose spec is narrower or wider than the real winget rule is
   the most valuable thing to catch — the corpus job is the ground truth.
4. **Tests** — is there at least one passing and one failing case? Are the fixtures realistic?
5. **Clarity and edge cases** worth a second look.

Prefer a few high-signal comments over many trivial ones. If the change is clean, say so plainly
rather than inventing problems.
