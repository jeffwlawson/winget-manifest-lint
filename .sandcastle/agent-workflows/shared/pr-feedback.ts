 * too permissive and GitHub rejects the whole review, too restrictive and
 * legitimate comments are dropped — both surface as a silent, empty review
 * (issue #71). So the base is the PR's real base, not a hardcoded `main`.

 * is what GitHub shows. A two-dot diff has different semantics and would
 * silently mis-filter; the fallback to it was deliberately removed once already
 * (see review-context.ts) — do not reintroduce it.
