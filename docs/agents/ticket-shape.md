# Ticket shape: a parent PRD with sub-issues

How `/to-tickets` publishes a batch of slices into this repo's tracker — the question
`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` deliberately left open until #93.

## The shape

```
#100  parent PRD          ← body is the /to-spec output; label: ready-for-agent
 ├── #101  slice 1        ← sub-issue, ready-for-agent
 ├── #102  slice 2        ← sub-issue, ready-for-agent, blocked-by #101
 └── #103  slice 3        ← sub-issue, ready-for-agent, blocked-by #102
```

Two relationships, doing different jobs:

- **parent / child** — containment. It is one PR per PRD, and it is the work-list
  `agent-implement-prd` walks.
- **`blocked-by`** — ordering, and the machine-readable record of *why* the order is what it is.

Both are **native** GitHub relations, not prose in a body. A `Blocked by: #12` line is invisible to
every consumer: the API does not report it, the UI does not draw it, and no workflow can act on it.

Upstream carries both, not either. #93 checked `mattpocock/course-video-manager` on 2026-08-07 —
its newest feature at the time, #1514–#1518 — and found #1517 carrying `Parent: #1514` **and**
`Blocked by: #1516`, with no sub-issue carrying a workflow trigger label. Re-check before trusting
that upstream still does it this way; the reasoning below stands on its own either way.

## Creation order is execution order

The load-bearing detail, and the one that is easy to get wrong while getting the shape right.

`agent-implement-prd.yml` targets *the first still-open sub-issue, in the order the sub-issues API
returns them*. It **never reads `blocked-by`.** That is only safe because the sub-issues are
*created* in dependency order — the topological sort happens once, at publish time, here.

So a batch published in the wrong order produces a chain that runs slices before their blockers,
and nothing catches it: the edges are right there, and nothing consults them. Sequence the
`gh issue create` calls yourself, blockers first, one at a time — a parallel publish has no
defined order, which is the same bug arriving by accident. (The other direction is settled too:
`agent-implement-prd.yml` says, in its header, *do not add edge-reading here; fix the publish order
instead*.)

**What the API returns is a position, not a timestamp.** Each sub-issue holds a place in the
parent's list; creating one appends it, which is why publishing in order is enough. But the place
is editable — by dragging in the parent's UI, or through
`PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/sub_issues/priority`. So the order is also *reorderable
after the fact*, which is the repair below, and the hazard: dragging a sub-issue in the parent
rewrites the execution order of a chain that has not run yet, silently and with no other effect
visible anywhere.

## Labels

| Issue | `/to-tickets` gives it | It never gets |
|---|---|---|
| the parent PRD | `ready-for-agent` | — (a human adds `agent:implement` later, deliberately) |
| each sub-issue | `ready-for-agent` | any `agent:*` label, ever |

`ready-for-agent` is triage's "fully specified", and a slice that isn't fully specified isn't a
slice yet — so every ticket in the batch carries it, which is `/to-tickets`' own default. Only the
**parent** is ever promoted to `agent:implement`, by a human, and that single label starts the
whole chain. See [`triage-labels.md`](./triage-labels.md) for why that promotion stays a human
hand, and for the two vocabularies it joins.

Labelling a sub-issue `agent:implement` does not fork the chain — `agent-implement.yml` refuses any
issue with a parent, and says to label the parent instead — but it is a refusal, not a plan. Don't
rely on it.

`agent:queued` is not part of this shape either. It is the tier *above*: dependencies between
top-level issues, promoted by a workflow this repo does not have. Within a PRD the ordering is
already carried by creation order, and the chain does not need to be told to wait.

## Publishing

`gh issue create` prints the new issue's URL as its last line; everything below keys off that.
`--parent` and `--blocked-by` need **`gh` >= 2.94.0** (the release that added issue types,
sub-issues and relationships to `gh issue`; verified present in 2.96.0). On an older `gh`, or where
the flags are unavailable, fall back to the REST endpoints — the `blocked_by` one is documented in
[`issue-tracker.md`](./issue-tracker.md#wayfinding-operations) and takes the blocker's numeric
**database id**, not its `#number`.

```bash
new() { basename "$(gh issue create "$@" | tail -n1)"; }

# 1. The parent. Its body is the /to-spec output, unedited.
prd=$(new --title "Adopt the PRD tier" --body-file spec.md --label "ready-for-agent")

# 2. The slices, one command per slice, in dependency order — blockers first.
s1=$(new --parent "$prd" --label "ready-for-agent" \
        --title "Slice 1: …" --body-file slice-1.md)
s2=$(new --parent "$prd" --label "ready-for-agent" --blocked-by "$s1" \
        --title "Slice 2: …" --body-file slice-2.md)
s3=$(new --parent "$prd" --label "ready-for-agent" --blocked-by "$s2" \
        --title "Slice 3: …" --body-file slice-3.md)
```

A slice that blocks on more than one earlier slice takes them all:
`--blocked-by "$s1,$s2"`. Edges only ever point *backwards*, at slices already created — a forward
edge means the order is wrong.

**Only publish slices you intend this chain to run.** The chain implements *every* open sub-issue,
so a slice parked as "maybe later" is a slice the chain will build. #91 had to be detached from #87
for exactly that reason. Park it as a standalone issue and link it from the PRD body instead.

## Verify natively before labelling anything

Not optional, and not a formality: upstream's `/to-tickets` does **not** reliably emit native
relations. As of #93 (2026-08-08), `mattpocock/skills` #513 records it writing a prose
`Blocked by:` line instead, and #262 — the issue tracking it — is still open. So a batch can look
perfect in the issue bodies and carry no edges at all. The prose reads the same either way; only
the API tells you which one you got.

Re-read all three, and read them the way the workflow does:

```bash
# The work-list, in the order the chain will walk it. This is the whole scheduling policy.
gh issue view "$prd" --json subIssues

# Per slice: the parent link, the edges, and that no agent:* label crept in.
gh issue view "$s2" --json number,parent,blockedBy,labels
```

For the authoritative check, run the query `agent-implement-prd.yml` runs — same connection, same
page size, same order:

```bash
gh api graphql -f owner=jeffwlawson -f name=winget-manifest-lint -F number="$prd" -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $name: String!, $number: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
      issue(number: $number) {
        subIssues(first: 100) { totalCount nodes { number title state } }
      }
    }
  }'
```

What to check, in order of how expensive it is to get wrong:

1. `nodes` lists every slice, **in dependency order**. This is the execution order. Nothing else
   sorts it.
2. Every slice has `parent` set to the PRD. A slice that missed the parent link is invisible to the
   chain — the PRD finishes without it, and nothing reports a gap.
3. Every slice after the first has the `blockedBy` edge the order implies.
4. `labels` is `ready-for-agent` and nothing else.

If the order is wrong, move the slice rather than recreating it — `gh` has no flag for this, so it
is the REST endpoint, and every id in it is a **database id**, not a `#number` (same trap as the
`blocked_by` endpoint in [`issue-tracker.md`](./issue-tracker.md#wayfinding-operations)):

```bash
id() { gh api "repos/jeffwlawson/winget-manifest-lint/issues/$1" --jq .id; }
gh api --method PATCH "repos/jeffwlawson/winget-manifest-lint/issues/$prd/sub_issues/priority" \
  -F sub_issue_id="$(id "$s3")" -F after_id="$(id "$s1")"
```

Then re-read the list and check it, because that is the only place the change shows up. Do this
before `agent:implement` reaches the parent; afterwards you are reordering a queue that is already
being consumed.

## What is kept, and what is overridden

`/to-tickets`' slicing judgement is the reason to run it, and it is kept in full: tracer bullets,
sizing each slice to one context, surfacing prefactoring first, expand–contract for wide refactors.

Overridden here, and only here:

| Upstream default | Here |
|---|---|
| publishes flat peers joined by blocking edges | a parent PRD with native sub-issues |
| no ordering contract on creation | created in dependency order, blockers first |
| `ready-for-agent` on every ticket "unless instructed otherwise" | kept — this file is that instruction for the `agent:*` labels only |

That last row is the seam. `/to-tickets` applies triage labels by default and says so; this file
is the "otherwise" it invites, and it spends it on one thing — no ticket in the batch gets a
workflow trigger label.

**Do not edit the upstream skill files to achieve any of this.** They are installed, not vendored,
and they get updated; a local edit is lost on the next update without telling anyone. The bridge
lives in this repo — `CLAUDE.md` and this directory — which is the constraint #87 states and the
reason `docs/agents/` exists at all.
