/**
 * `parseDiffLines` builds the allow-list that inline review comments are
 * filtered against. GitHub rejects an *entire* review if one comment anchors
 * outside the diff, so an off-by-one here does not degrade a review — it
 * silently posts nothing. The core is the new-file line counter: added and
 * context lines advance it, removed lines do not, and each `@@` header reloads
 * it from the new-file start.
 *
 * Every diff below is real `git diff` output (generated, then pasted), including
 * its trailing newline — that is what `git(["diff", …])` hands the parser in
 * production. The parser strips that trailing newline before splitting, so the
 * trailing empty string it would otherwise yield is not counted: no phantom line
 * is emitted past the end of the diff's final file. The tests below can and do
 * assert exact set equality on the line sets they target.
