/**
 * The runners ship as one versioned package with one binary (#96), so the entry
 * point is a subcommand table rather than five scripts addressed by path. Two
 * properties are worth holding mechanically:
 *
 * - **every runner is reachable.** A workflow directory with no table entry is a
 *   runner that exists and cannot be invoked, and nothing else would notice —
 *   the old form named the file directly, so adding one was self-wiring.
 * - **every asset a runner reads is shipped.** `files: ["dist"]` publishes
 *   compiled JS and nothing else, so a prompt that the build does not copy
 *   resolves to a path that exists in the source tree and not in the tarball.
 *   That failure only appears on a published version, in CI, in another repo.
 *
 * The table is deliberately open: `init` and `doctor` (#112) are two more
 * entries, so the checks below say *every runner is a command*, never *every
 * command is a runner*.
