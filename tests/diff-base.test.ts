/**
 * The review's inline-comment allow-list is built from the same diff GitHub uses
 * to define the PR. GitHub diffs against the PR's *base branch* merge-base, so
 * this command must too — diffing against a hardcoded `main` on a stacked PR
 * pulls in the intermediate branch's lines, the allow-list disagrees with
 * GitHub's, and GitHub rejects the entire review silently (issue #71). Only the
 * base is a variable; the seam worth testing is which base is chosen, so these
 * assert the exact argv.
 *
 * Argv, not a command string: the base ref reaches `git` as one argument via
 * `execFileSync` and is never shell-parsed (issue #75). The last case pins that
 * a metacharacter ref passes through verbatim — no escaping, no splitting; the
 * "no shell" half of that guarantee lives in `git()` in common.ts.
